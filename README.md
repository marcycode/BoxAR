# Conda environment setup

First, ensure you have conda installed. If not, you can download it from [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

Then, create a new conda environment with the following command:

```bash
conda env create -f conda_env.yml
```

This will create a new environment called `boxar` with all the necessary dependencies. To activate the environment, run:

```bash
conda activate boxar
```
